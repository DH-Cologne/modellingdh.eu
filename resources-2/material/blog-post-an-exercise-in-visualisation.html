                  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
                  <p>
                    This post details the theoretical considerations and the
                    practicalities that informed the development of a network
                    graph to visualise the etymological connections and semantic
                    clusters associated with the English term “model”. These
                    linguistic relationships are detailed in a forthcoming paper
                    by Cristina Marras and Michela Tardella entitled “Modelling
                    between Digital and Humanities: Looking Back and Forward”.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Marras and Tardella investigate the polysemy of the term
                    “model” by exploring its etymological roots and by
                    distinguishing words that have been closely associated with
                    “model” and which, taken together, constitute a semantic
                    cluster or network of associated terms. By outlining its
                    etymological history and by identifying words that have been
                    associated with “model” the authors do not aim to account
                    for uses of “model” and its inflections in varieties of
                    contemporary academic discourse. Rather, they delineate the
                    semantic scope of these terms more broadly, thereby
                    providing a ground for further investigations into the
                    academic usage of these terms in the humanities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Marras and Tardella identify two senses of modelling, one
                    relating to ‘formal ways of reasoning and representation
                    (mathematical and deductive forms for example)’ and one
                    relating to ‘less formal processes of reasoning involving
                    metaphorical, inductive, and abductive forms’. This paper
                    investigates senses of “model” and its inflections that are
                    related to both categories but notes that the latter has yet
                    to be ‘“fully recognized” as a form of modelling adequate to
                    DH’. After outlining the term’s etymology, interlinguistic
                    equivalents and lexicography, the authors explore
                    twenty-eight associated terms that together form a semantic
                    net or cloud before concluding the paper with an overview of
                    the terms in various disciplines in the sciences and
                    humanities.

                  <h2>2. Some Preliminary Considerations</h2>
                  <p>
                    I took up the task of developing a visualisation that would
                    support the discursive overview of the etymological roots of
                    “model” and its associated terms. Because the relationships
                    between these terms are complex and because there are a
                    large number of terms associated with “model”, a visual
                    representation offers a quick and easy way to make sense of
                    these connections. The visualisation could then function as
                    an index for the discursive outline provided by the paper.
                    Developing this visualisation enables us to pilot these
                    techniques in preparation for further visualisations that
                    could be used to represent the findings from an analysis of
                    a corpus of academic journal articles constructed to
                    investigate modelling in the humanities.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As the visualisation will be reproduced in a forthcoming
                    volume of articles on modelling in the humanities as well as
                    being showcased on the project website, it would need to be
                    developed in such a way that it could be reproduced as a
                    static image. Furthermore, there were technical limitations
                    relating to my own programming expertise, which was scant at
                    best, and limitations relating to the length of time
                    available to me on the project: at five months, there was
                    little scope to learn to develop a suite of visualisations
                    while constructing and analysing a corpus of journal
                    articles. These constraints shaped my choice of
                    visualisation and the platform I used to develop it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While the visualisation is a supplement to a longer article,
                    however, it also needs to be understood in isolation from
                    that article when encountered solely on the project website.
                    The open-access nature of the publication to which it is
                    attached mitigates the strength of the dissociation between
                    its source material and its representation online but the
                    lack of context for the graph needs to be recognised as it
                    will have repercussions for the way the visualisation is
                    understood.

                  <h2>3. Choosing and Planning the Graph</h2>
                  <p>
                    After reviewing several possible options, which I discuss
                    below, I decided that a network graph would be the most
                    suitable option for representing the relationships between
                    entities. It is also relatively simple to learn to produce
                    within the available timeframe. I chose to use d3.js to
                    develop this visualisation because it was free, offered a
                    great amount of flexibility for control and styling of the
                    final graph and is easy to adapt for future analyses—for
                    example, by using statistical measures and frequencies to
                    define the length of the connections (‘edges’) between
                    specific terms and those that co-occur with them. I was soon
                    to learn that for those of us with little to no programming
                    experience, d3.js has a steep learning curve. Nevertheless,
                    within a relatively short amount of time (Albeit inversely
                    proportional to the level of frustration I was to experience
                    in the following weeks), I was able to develop a graph that
                    can be re-used throughout the lifecycle of the project.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Marras and Tardella explore etymological and semantic
                    relatedness, encompassing historical and synonymous uses as
                    well as terms in translation. Representing these different
                    levels of relations meant that the visualisation either
                    needed to flatten them or encapsulate two different
                    organising principles (temporal and semantic, for example).
                    I first experimented with a structure that organised
                    etymological relationships as a “backbone” for the network
                    graph, with the twenty-eight terms of the semantic cloud
                    organised around this core. These twenty-eight terms would
                    connect with the primary backbone at all relevant points to
                    indicate a link between them (for example, a link between
                    measurement and the Greek root of model). Using space in
                    this way to represent these different levels, however, made
                    the visualisation difficult to read with ease. The
                    complexity that stratifying these levels spatially would
                    introduce to the visualisation runs counter to the principle
                    of simplicity and immediacy to which the visualisation was
                    intended and so I chose not to represent these different
                    levels spatially, but to introduce colour to group those
                    terms that were related in a specific way (so that all Greek
                    roots, for example, were of one colour). This meant that the
                    network graph would not be organised in terms of time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another consideration that required some thought was that
                    the authors did not analyse any datasets in quantitative
                    terms to support the identification of qualitative
                    relationships. This meant that the distance between nodes or
                    the thickness of the connections between nodes couldn’t be
                    used to represent, for example, the strength of the
                    association between two terms based on the evidence of some
                    supporting data analysis. The distances between terms were
                    thus governed by aesthetic and pragmatic reasons and not by
                    quantitative measures. While the network graph that I
                    eventually constructed allows us to see which terms are
                    related to which, the connections between terms are
                    meaningful only insofar as they indicate some specific
                    semantic connection raised in the article. The network graph
                    thus shows us which terms are related to “model” and it
                    shows us which of these terms are related to others, but it
                    does not assign any information with regard to the type or
                    strength of the connection itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Each group of related terms are colour coded and labels for
                    each are contained in a legend. Devising the groups proved
                    to be tricky as terms tended to overlap with one another. In
                    some cases I adhered to the groups that were defined by the
                    paper itself and created connections between terms that were
                    clearly related. For example, the Latin root “Modus” refers
                    to ‘a measure’, which is also one of the twenty-eight words
                    explicitly noted by the paper to be semantically related to
                    ‘model’. As the paper discussed Latin terms as one group and
                    terms relating to measurement in another section of the
                    paper, I chose not to collapse these terms into a single
                    group. The benefit of this approach is that the network
                    graph preserves the groups and the relationships discussed
                    in the paper but still allows us to make these relationships
                    explicit. In other cases, however, I created a single group
                    for terms that are related in English. An example of this
                    decision includes the terms “Resemblance”, “Copy”,
                    “Imitation”, “Simulation”, “Similarity” and “Analogue”,
                    which all relate to the concept of similarity. The choice of
                    name for each group was derived from the terms within that
                    group itself and is, of course, highly subjective; arguments
                    for other choices of label could very well be made.

                  <h2>4. Implementing the Graph</h2>
                  <p>
                    We now come to the most time-consuming aspect of the
                    visualisation, which I record here for posterity. Perhaps my
                    travails will be of some use to those who follow in my
                    footsteps. ‘You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has
                    accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have
                    regarded with such evil forebodings’ (<a
                      href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm"
                      ><em>Frankenstein</em></a
                    >). Indeed, the construction of the code for the
                    visualisation resembled nothing so much as a monstrous
                    stitching together of human and animal body parts in
                    <em
                      ><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/84/84-h/84-h.htm"

                    >
                    to create something new from its constituents. Implementing
                    the graph involved a long process of trial and error, yet
                    the flexibility offered for future adaptations made the
                    effort worth the trial.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were a range of network graphs available as models
                    through the d3.js library. I opted to adapt
                    <a href="https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045"
                      ><em>Mike Bostock’s force-directed network graph</em></a
                    >. I needed to adjust various elements of the code and the
                    json data for my own purposes, particularly with future
                    applications in mind. To this end I inserted a legend,
                    introduced new fields in the json file within which to
                    insert quantitative data to determine the length and
                    thickness of the connections between nodes and inserted
                    labels for each of the nodes. As we were using Greek and
                    Latin characters I also needed to ensure that they would be
                    displayed correctly, and thus included a line of code to
                    define the type of encoding the browser was required to
                    read. The html file could then be dragged and dropped into a
                    Firefox browser to view and interact with the dynamic
                    visualisation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I then created an Excel template that separated each part of
                    the json data into individual cells so that new data could
                    be copied and pasted into the relevant column. A final
                    column that concatenated the data in the separated columns
                    enabled me to quickly generate code that could be copy and
                    pasted into a json file, which could then be used to
                    generate the network graph in a short amount of time. The
                    distances between all the nodes of the graph can thus be
                    adjusted simply by entering new values in the relevant Excel
                    column and copy and pasting the data from the concatenated
                    column of the Excel spreadsheet into the relevant section of
                    the json file. Likewise the width of all of the connections,
                    or edges, between nodes can be modified, as can the
                    groupings of terms that is used to generate the colours of
                    the nodes and the accompanying legend. This enables us to
                    re-purpose the network graph to generate visualisations of
                    quantitative data based on linguistic and statistical
                    analyses of textual corpora. The dynamic graph itself can be
                    manually re-arranged so that static images can be generated
                    through screen capture.

                  <h2>5. Future Directions</h2>
                  <p>
                    As a first attempt at creating a visualisation that could be
                    re-deployed for other purposes, this exercise was successful
                    for a number of reasons. First and foremost I had to learn
                    how to navigate the d3.js library and the host of resources
                    and tutorials available, which was possibly the most
                    time-consuming and difficult element of this exercise. It
                    also allowed me to learn how to program using Javascript and
                    css to produce something immediately relevant to the
                    project. It required me to think about the relationship
                    between elements of a visualisation and to consider how best
                    to represent a discursive account visually. Along the way I
                    researched a range of other types of visualisation and
                    learnt how to adapt examples for my own purposes.
                    Theoretically it allowed me to think more deeply about
                    modelling and to tease apart the relationships between
                    etymologically linked and semantically associated terms.
                    This activity reflects one aspect of the practicalities
                    involved in modelling, namely that the act of creating a
                    model involves the modeller in an iterative, experimental
                    process that enables individuals to learn from the
                    implementation itself.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    There were a number of features I attempted to implement but
                    was unable to do so given the time and knowledge constraints
                    I was working against. I initially attempted to define
                    groups using hulls following
                    <em
                      ><a href="http://bl.ocks.org/GerHobbelt/3071239"
                        >Ger Hobbelt’s model</a
                      ></em
                    >. That proved difficult and so I scaled back my ambition
                    and tried to implement hulls following
                    <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/AaronBramson/0smgr510/7/"
                      ><em>Aaron Bramson’s model</em></a
                    >. The success I had achieved thus far persuaded me that I
                    was equal to this no doubt trivial task. I was proved wrong
                    and abandoned this approach in favour of a simpler
                    colour-coded system with an accompanying legend to designate
                    groups.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I also investigated other types of visualisation. In
                    particular I was attracted to the notion of a timeline that
                    could be embedded in a webpage. I successfully adapted an
                    example using d3.js and so my programming expertise was not
                    a barrier to implementing this visualisation. The reason I
                    opted for a network diagram was because it lends itself to
                    publication as a static image while an interactive timeline
                    that requires the user to click through to access other
                    parts of the narrative does not. However, because the paper
                    tells a story of the development of the term “model”, a
                    timeline offers the benefit of explicating this story in a
                    visually attractive and intuitive manner. It would also
                    allow me to extend the visualisation by including examples
                    of the terms as they were used at various points in history
                    in a manner similar to the Oxford English Dictionary’s
                    online database of examples. This resource offers a useful
                    touchstone for scholars wishing to explore modelling from
                    interdisciplinary perspectives and could form a valuable
                    addition to the project, perhaps as part of a postulated
                    phase II extension.

                    Dendrograms offer another possible type of visualisation
                    that could be used to visualise “model” and its roots and
                    associated terms. I opted not to use this type of graph
                    because of its hierarchised structure, which did not suit
                    the kinds of relationships that I was portraying. However,
                    these could be used to visualise findings from an analysis
                    of the corpus of journal articles that I shall be
                    constructing and is particularly suited to representing the
                    terms that co-occur with “model”, its inflections or with
                    associated terms. This visualisation offers another way to
                    explore the large amounts of data that a corpus linguistic
                    analysis of modelling in journal articles would uncover.

                    The final product was not exactly what I had aimed for when
                    I set out to create the visualisation. Nevertheless, it was
                    very close, and I was able to devise alternative solutions
                    to work around the problems involved in implementing some of
                    the more ambitious features of the network graph. Overall,
                    despite the steep learning curve I found my first engagement
                    with d3.js a rewarding experience. In a short amount of time
                    I was able to familiarise myself with some of the principles
                    of visualising data, learn how to use basic Javascript and
                    CSS to create tools that I will likely use throughout my
                    career, and to engage with modelling in the humanities.
